# Industry Insights Assignment

## Learning Objectives

  1. Explore your local technology community.
  2. Network with technology industry professionals.
  3. Increase awareness of industry practices and issues.

## Instructions

Search [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) for, or otherwise identify business, startup, and/or technology-related events in the Washington, DC area or some other place near where you live. Focus on data and software-related events if possible. You are encouraged to post links to interesting events in the `#meetups` Slack channel.

Identify and attend one event over the course of the semester to be eligible for an 80%. Attend two events to be eligible for 100%.

For each event, write a short (2-3 page) summary of your experiences,
 to address at least the following questions:

 + Which event did you attend, which group(s) hosted it, and what happened?
 + What, if anything, did you learn about contemporary industry issues and practices?
 + Would you recommend the group to a friend? Why or why not?

Embed photos to provide further evidence of event attendance. A "selfie" should suffice if it features distinguishable event imagery in the background.

## Alternate Assignment - Informational Interviews

If the idea of attending business and technology community events makes you uncomfortable, or if your schedule prohibits you from attending two events before the end of the semester,
 you have another option. You may substitute one meetup event with two informational interviews of some active member within the business and technology community. Conduct two interviews to be eligible for 80%. Conduct three interviews to be eligible for 100%.

After each interview, write a short (1-2 page) summary of your experiences,
to address at least the following questions:

  + Which professionals did you interview? Include their contact info and a description of their professional roles/duties.
  + How are their professions relevant to the business/technology community?
  + What happened during each interview? What relevant topics were discussed?
  + How did your discussions relate to your own skills and interests?
  + What did you learn about contemporary industry challenges and practices?

Embed the contact information (names and email addresses) of all interviewees to provide further evidence of interview participation.
